In 2025, I received an interview invitation from FeedMe, a Malaysian company that develops online ordering systems. After an initial HR call, I was given a [code test](https://github.com/feedmepos/se-take-home-assignment) to create a McDonald's order system.

At the time, I really wanted to get the offer, so I spent about four hours building a McDonald's order system based on my understanding. [You can find the code here](https://github.com/wengjincheng/se-take-home-assignment). After waiting for three days, HR contacted me to schedule the next—and final—interview round with the CTO. 

I thought to myself: “Wow, was my code that impressive? The CTO must have reviewed it and thought I’d be a great software engineer—let’s assess his skills!” The final round took place at 7 PM GMT+8 (China Time, same as Malaysia). To my surprise, there were four interviewers present, though only the CTO asked questions. What’s more, it became clear he hadn’t read my code beforehand. He asked me to explain my solution, then described a new feature and asked me to code it live. Honestly, I didn’t implement it perfectly, but it worked.

As you might guess—yes, I failed that round. Still, I don’t blame FeedMe or the CTO. It was a good interview experience, and the CTO struck me as a skilled engineer. What I do want to say is this: please think twice before spending too much time on take-home coding projects. There’s a very high chance no one will actually read or review your code thoroughly. Moving to the next round might simply depend on your profile or background—not the effort you put into the test.

Use that time instead to learn something new, be with your family, exercise… invest your time in what truly matters.
